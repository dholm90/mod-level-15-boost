# Level 15 Boost

## Description
"Level 15 Boost" is a module for AzerothCore that offers an optional level boost to level 15, available as a gossip option at each race's starting zone initial quest giver. This module is designed to enhance the player experience by providing a quick start option for players who wish to skip the early leveling phase.

## Features
- Automatic boost to level 15 via a gossip option with the initial quest giver in each race's starting zone.
- Destruction of starting items and equipping players with appropriate gear, talents, and glyphs based on configuration.
- Configurable options for enabling or disabling specific features like learning spells, proficiencies, talents, dual spec, and destroying gear.
- Ability to reload tables and extract gear templates based on player's current gear.

## Requirements
Set EnforceItemAttributes.Enable to 0 in the `worldserver.conf` otherwise the display id's of starting gear will not be correct.

## Configuration
The module includes several configurable options in the `mod_level_15_boost.conf` file:


```ini
# Level 15 Boost
LevelBoost.Enable = 1

# Learn Spells
LearnSpells.Enable = 1

```

## Usage Instructions
